Ciallo~ Welcome to my blog! I am Comi, a computer science student passionate about exploration. In this blog, I mainly translate and share articles and literature from a leftist perspective, offering diverse thoughts and viewpoints.

In my blog, you will find discussions on various topics, from social issues to technological developments. I hope to share insights into this strange world through translation and commentary. I believe that the dissemination of knowledge and the exchange of ideas can promote broader social understanding and progress.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find inspiration and enjoyment here! If you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to reach out to me anytime.
